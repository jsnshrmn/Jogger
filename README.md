# Jogger

A Frogger clone for the Nintendo Game Boy. Developed for Wikimedia Inspiration Week 2022.

Created with [GBDK 2020 4.0.6](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020/tree/4.0.6/), using [template_subfolders](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020/tree/4.0.6/gbdk-lib/examples/gb/template_subfolders) as a starting point.


## From template_subfolders ##

A template project with a Makefile that supports sub-directories.

The Makefile will automatically detect and compile new source files
when they are added to the "src" and "res" directories.

Project directories
  - src: Main program source files (.c, .h, .s) can go here
  - res: Program graphics and audio source files (.c, .h, .s) can go here
  - obj: Compiled ROM (.gb) and debug files go in this directory
